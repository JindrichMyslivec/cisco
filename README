# CISCO server
#

Create a small service that will accept json file with some data (anything, e.g. information about cars) at the rest API and store it somehow (preferably some in-memory DB, but up to you). Make another API endpoint to retrieve all stored items. Technology: use Java + any open source libraries you want.


#
# Building
#

Building with Ant. Use Java 8 from Oracle.

ant compile;   # compile all source files
ant war;       # compile source files and create WAR file
ant tests;     # run all JUnit tests


#
# Deploying
#

Simply copy WAR file dist/cisco.war to your application server


#
# Documentation

Please check HTML do documentation in doc/index.html. This documentation is part of WAR. After deploying open root URL {application.server}/cisco/ like http://localhost:8080/cisco/


#
# Test with curl
